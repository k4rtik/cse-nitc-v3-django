This was an attempt to create a dynamic site using Python based web framework - Django.

The dynamic part of the site was going really well with this, but it was not practical
to implement all the basic features required for maintenance of the site by the non-technical
staff members.

Major work was done during May 2010, see the screenshots to have a look at the decent admin
interface made available with Django.
